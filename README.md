### Lift History

Lift history will be a web app (eventually native app as well) that aims to simplify the loathsome task of logging your workout.

As an avid gym goer, I rarely see anyone logging their exercises. The siting of a journal and pencil is a blue moon, and most people are busy shuffling music or scrolling social media between sets. My goal is to take the nuisance out of logging.
